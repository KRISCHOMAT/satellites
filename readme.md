## A multichannel performance where the mobilephones in the audience become speakers ##

In this project I use Super Collider to record audio samples and to send OSC (Open Sound Protocol) messages to clients. The clients can load the audio files and when receiving a OSC message they gonna play the sample based on the data in the OSC message. With that I can controll and sequence the mobile phones.
